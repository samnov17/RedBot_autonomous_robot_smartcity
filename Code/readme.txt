Two Raspberry Pi 4s, in combination with serially connected Arduinos, are used on both the robot and infrastructure sides.

The Arduino on the robot side is from RedBot, and the wheels and robot structure are also from the same company.

The Arduino code is in .ino files, and the other code is in .py files.
