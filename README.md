Autonomous Robot for Smart City

1. Project Overview
   
    This project was part of our master's program in the course "Design of Embedded Systems." The theme for this year was "Connected City," and we were required to collaborate with other groups to create both a robot and infrastructure for a smart city environment.

2. Initial Proposal
   
   The file "Initial_proposal.pdf" outlines our initial plan and how we intended to execute this project.

3. Robot Design
   
   To build the robot, we used the RedBot Arduino platform and its in-house sensors such as infrared line sensors and wheel encoders for basic navigation. Additionally, we mounted spirals on each robot for enhanced navigation. For communication, we used ROS commands and LCM implemented on a Raspberry Pi to broadcast our messages publicly or privately using different channels.

4. 3D Printing and Modeling
   
   Secure placement of components was crucial, so we 3D printed the majority of the parts using SketchUp for 3D modeling. On the infrastructure side, we 3D printed streetlights and gates, and used cardboard for larger structures. The "3d_printing" folder contains vector files for all the parts used.

5. Code and Implementation
    
   The "Code" folder contains all the code used for the Arduino platform as well as the Python scripts for this implementation. We used the Putty terminal to connect to these terminals wirelessly for ease of use.

6. Report and Documentation
       
   The detailed report, "DEIS_final_report_group4.pdf," provides an overall idea of the project. Additional photos and videos of the project in real-time operation are also included in this repository.
